[pending]

+ Fix distortion that happens during rotation and a texture is active on the rotated mesh.
+ Implement draw layer
+ Display frame draw metric on screen (i.e. FPS, Triangles Counter, etc).
+ Get video frame rate from monitor and enforce it
+ Texture mapping
	+ Textured triangles
	+ Baycentric Cordinates
		+ Baycentric Weights
+ Fully/90%  compliant .obj file parser.
+ Texture mapping using PNG
+ Textured OBJ files
+ Z-Buffer
+ Camera
+ Clipping
+ Multiple Meshes
+ Make DPI Scaling and refresh rates at the OS layer more roboust.
+ Profiler. Maybe first with Tracy then make a customized one as needs become clearer.
+ Make the BackBuffer not too platform specific. The current implementation stores WIN32 BITMAPINFO, we would like that to not be the case. 
	Render functions copying from he backbuffer to the windows are also WIN32 specific, this is not desireble as it creates dependence of engine 
	code on the platform. The Engine code should not be aware of the platform it is running on, it should know handle 
	engine stuff and reach out to the OS layer when it needs OS things.  
+ Create state to handle mesh rotation, scaling and translation with mouse instead of auto rotation and scaling.
+ Parse command line options
+ Logging
+ SIMD calculation for math, this would significantly speed up matrix calculations.
+ Multithreading
