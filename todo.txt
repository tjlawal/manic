+ Texture mapping
	+ Textured triangles
	+ Flat-Bottom triangle
	+ Flat-Top triangle
	+ Baycentric Cordinates
		+ Baycentric Weights
+ Texture mapping using PNG
+ Textured OBJ files
+ Z-Buffer
+ Camera
+ Clipping
+ Multiple Meshes

01-08-2025: 

+ Parse command line options
+ Logging
+ Multithreading
+ SIMD calculation for math, this would significantly speed up matrix calculations.
+ Handle DPI Scaling and refresh rates at the OS layer.
+ Make the BackBuffer not too platform specific. The current implementation stores WIN32 BITMAPINFO, we would like that to not be the case. 
	Render functions copying from he backbuffer to the windows are also WIN32 specific, this is not desireble as it creates dependence of engine code on the platform. 
	The Engine code should not be aware of the platform it is running on, it should know handle engine stuff and reach out to the OS layer when it needs OS things.  
+ Profiler. Maybe first with Tracy then make a customized one as needs become clearer.
+ FPS Counter, Triangles Counter
+ Fully/90%  compliant .obj file parser.
+ Create state to handle mesh rotation, scaling and translation with mouse instead of auto rotation and scalling.


- Map keyboard shortcuts to setting render modes.
