Manic

Manic is a game engine equipped with a software renderer. Why? This project is a playground to see how game engines are made, specifically how 2D and 3D renderers are built. I wager that it is better to learn how all the underlying systems work in an intricate manner and understand them before getting GPU's involved. It is also meant to serve as a testing bed to see how to write performance critical software.
